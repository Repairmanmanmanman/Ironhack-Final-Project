# The Twitter Paradox
Contains all the resources and code used for my final project.
The Twitter Paradox is the presentation, saved as pdf and pptx.
The IPYNB File called Twitter API Scraping Notes contains the actual Twitter Scraper.
The other IPYNB Files contain the sentiment analysis using the tweets obtained from the scraper.
The tweets were saved in CSV files. Jokers tweets are saved in "ua" and Gillette tweets in "Gillette".
